### My Coding Journey 💻✨

Welcome to my personal coding journey repo—a place where I experiment, learn, and level up across Python, C, and C++.
Think of it as my sandbox for learning, practicing, and tracking growth. 😎

📂 What’s Inside

Python/ – Scripts, notebooks, and exercises

C/ – Programs, practice exercises, and small projects

C++/ – Practice code, snippets, and experiments

HTML - Exploring the start and literally making baby steps towards web page designing

CSS - Styling my pages , my way.

JavaScript - Building the logic of the website like a boss.

(Future additions: other languages, projects)
