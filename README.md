### My Coding Journey 💻✨

Welcome to my personal coding journey repo—a place where I experiment, learn, and level up across Python, C, and C++.
Think of it as my sandbox for learning, practicing, and tracking growth. 😎

📂 What’s Inside

Python/ – Scripts, notebooks, and exercises

C/ – Programs, practice exercises, and small projects

C++/ – Practice code, snippets, and experiments

(Future additions: other languages, projects)

⚡ How I Use This Repo

It’s my personal playground, so code may be messy or experimental

I track my learning progress, test new ideas, and keep reference code here

Everything is for practice and learning purposes

🛠️ Tech / Languages

Python – for scripts, automation, and data experiments

C – for basic programming practice, logic, and system understanding

C++ – for object-oriented programming, DSA, and advanced exercises


🔲 Advanced projects / multi-language integration
